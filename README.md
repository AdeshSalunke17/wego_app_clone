# **Wego App Clone**

This project is my first React application, where Iâ€™ve created a clone of the home page of the Wego travel app. It is built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the React library. The project also incorporates React routing and several packages, including Framer Motion, i18next, Bootstrap, react-router-dom, and various styling libraries. Currently, the application is somewhat less responsive on mobile devices, which is an area for future improvement.
